# __init__.py

## Explanation
This module extends the core simulator to implement a Bitcoin simulator. It is designed to simulate the behavior of the Bitcoin network for testing and development purposes.

## Dependencies
This module may have dependencies on the core simulator module and other related modules. The exact dependencies would depend on the specific implementation and usage of this module.

## Classes
There are no classes defined in this module.

## Functions
There are no functions defined in this module.

## Example usage
As this module is an extension of the core simulator, it would typically be used in the context of simulating a Bitcoin network. An example usage might look like this:

```python
from bitcoin_simulator import BitcoinSimulator

# Initialize the simulator
simulator = BitcoinSimulator()

# Run the simulator
simulator.run()
```

In this example, the `BitcoinSimulator` class is imported from the `bitcoin_simulator` module. An instance of the `BitcoinSimulator` class is then created and the simulator is run using the `run` method.
