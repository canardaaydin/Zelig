# __init__.py

## Explanation
The `__init__.py` file is a special Python file that allows a directory to become a Python package so that modules can be imported from it. In this case, the `__init__.py` file is used to initialize the `sim` module, which contains the core simulator.

## Dependencies
This file does not have any explicit dependencies. However, it implicitly depends on the Python interpreter and the modules and packages in the same directory.

## Classes
There are no classes defined in this file.

## Functions
There are no functions defined in this file.

## Example usage
Typically, you don't directly interact with the `__init__.py` file. It's automatically executed when the package or a module in the package is imported. For example, if you have a `sim` module in the same directory, you can import it in another Python file as follows:

```python
import sim
```

This will execute the `__init__.py` file and initialize the `sim` module.
